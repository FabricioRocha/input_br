# Database ("Organize suas coleções" / "Streamline your hobbies files")

This was published in two parts, both in INPUT volume 1 (also in the English edition). As for the description, it is an old school, flat database program where the user can define recors and fields, fill them all as desired and save to a file. Yes, to your very own storage device, not on a cloud! We had a bit more privacy then I guess.

The circa 6.800 characters MSX BASIC code is written to use a casette tape for file I/O. It might be easily adapted for the usage of a disk drive, but it might not run as the MSX Disk BASIC uses some more of the few RAM bytes available. 


## Operation

A very typical 70s/80s modal interface with a numerical main menu from which every functionality is accessed: create a new database, input data, list records, search into a specific field, save database file, load database file and exit.
